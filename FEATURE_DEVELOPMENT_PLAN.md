## Risk Assessment for Beta

### 🚨 High Risk Items
1. **No file write capability** - Tasks can't be saved back to org files
2. **Missing core pages** - 2 of 6 main pages don't exist
3. **No task creation flow** - Users can't add new tasks
4. **No search** - Finding tasks is difficult

### ⚠️ Medium Risk Items
1. **Limited mobile support** - Navigation not responsive
2. **No error handling** - App crashes on errors
3. **No tests** - Quality assurance concerns
4. **Performance unknowns** - Not tested with large datasets

## Recommendations

### For Fastest Beta Release:
1. **Focus only on P0 items** (28 hours of work)
2. **Defer all UI enhancements** (dark mode, animations)
3. **Implement basic versions first** (simple search, basic filters)
4. **Add polish in post-beta updates**

### Beta Release Milestones:
1. **Milestone 1:** Core pages (Projects, Tasks, Settings) - 18h
2. **Milestone 2:** Task creation modal - 6h
3. **Milestone 3:** Search functionality - 4h
4. **Milestone 4:** Bug fixes and testing - 8h

## Summary

**Current Status:** 60% complete for beta release
**Remaining Work:** 14 hours of P0 features
**Estimated Timeline:** 1.75-3.5 days depending on resources
**Main Blockers:** Missing Settings page and task creation flow

The application has a solid foundation with excellent architecture and styling, but lacks several critical features needed for a functional GTD system. Focusing on the P0 items will bring the app to beta-ready status quickly.
