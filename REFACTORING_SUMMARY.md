## 🔄 Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
1. **Refactor taskStore.ts** to use BaseTaskStore
   - Remove all duplicate methods
   - Use base implementation
   - Estimated time: 1 hour

2. **Refactor contextStore.ts** to eliminate duplication
   - Update to use BaseTaskStore
   - Remove redundant methods
   - Estimated time: 1 hour

### Medium Priority
3. **Add Unit Tests** for stores
   - Test BaseTaskStore methods
   - Test store selectors
   - Test store initialization
   - Estimated time: 3 hours

## 💡 Code Quality Improvements
