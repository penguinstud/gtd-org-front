# Configuration Updates - Code Cleanup

This document outlines the configuration changes made during the code cleanup process.

## Date: 2025-01-13

### ESLint Configuration (.eslintrc.json)

**Issue**: TypeScript ESLint plugin was incorrectly referenced.

**Fix**: Changed from `@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended`

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "next/core-web-vitals",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"  // Fixed: Added 'plugin:' prefix
  ]
}
```

### Next.js Configuration (next.config.js)

**Issues**:
1. Duplicate experimental blocks
2. Deprecated `appDir` configuration

**Fixes**:
1. Removed duplicate experimental configuration blocks
2. Removed deprecated `appDir` option (Next.js 14 has app directory enabled by default)

### TypeScript Configuration (tsconfig.json)

**Issue**: Path mappings didn't match actual directory structure

**Fix**: Added missing path mapping for the lib directory:
```json
{
  "paths": {
    "@/*": ["./src/*"],
    "@/lib/*": ["./src/lib/*"]  // Added this mapping
  }
}
```

### Code Quality Improvements

1. **Logger Utility**: Created `src/lib/utils/logger.ts` to centralize console usage
   - Wraps console methods with environment checks
   - Prevents console statements in production builds
   - Provides a consistent logging interface

2. **TypeScript Type Safety**: Fixed numerous `any` type issues:
   - Daily page: Fixed unused variable and React Hook dependencies
   - Inbox page: Added proper type assertions for Priority and TaskStatus
   - Security files: Replaced `any` with proper Next.js types (`NextApiRequest`, `NextApiResponse`)
   - Used `unknown` type where appropriate for better type safety

3. **ESLint Compliance**: Fixed all ESLint errors that were blocking the build:
   - Removed unused variables
   - Fixed console statement usage
   - Corrected TypeScript type annotations

### Build Process

The build now completes successfully with only non-blocking warnings. The remaining warnings about `any` types in:
- `StoreSelectors.ts`
- `orgParser.ts` 
- `health.ts`

These can be addressed in a future iteration but don't prevent successful builds.

### Best Practices Applied

1. **Strict TypeScript**: Avoided `any` types where possible
2. **Environment-aware Logging**: Console statements only in development
3. **Clean Configuration**: Removed deprecated and duplicate settings
4. **Type Safety**: Proper type imports and assertions throughout
