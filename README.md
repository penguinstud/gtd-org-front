## 🎨 Design System

### Color Palette (Monday.com Style)
- **Primary:** `#0073EA` - Professional blue
- **Success:** `#00C853` - Green
- **Progress:** `#FFEB3B` - Yellow  
- **Blocked:** `#E53935` - Red

We've adopted **Atomic Design** methodology over a flat structure for:
- Better component hierarchy and reusability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Industry-standard patterns
- Superior scalability

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Framework:** React 18 + Next.js 14
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Design Tokens
- **State:** Zustand (lightweight, type-safe)
- **File Integration:** Local org-mode files
- **Build:** Docker-ready containerization
